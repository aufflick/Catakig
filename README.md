Catakig
=======

Catakig is an emulator for the popular Apple II series of personal computers, supporting the Apple ][, ][+, //e, and //c models.

Catakig is an open-source project, released under a BSD style of license. It is generally free for use (but please read the included license before distributing or modifying).

Catakig's main project website is: http://catakig.sourceforge.net/

I have just forked the project to enable building on Lion and may work on it in the future.


Original Catakig Read-Me.txt
============================


Catakig is an emulator for the 8-bit family of Apple II personal computers.  It works on PowerPC Macs running MacOS X 10.3 or later, or Intel Macs running MacOS X 10.4 or later.  It is offered under a BSD style of Open Source license.  

To install Catakig, drag and copy the "Catakig" folder in this disk image to a convenient place on your hard drive.  You can put it in your "Applications" area, or anywhere else you'd prefer.  In order to do anything useful with Catakig, you will also need some ROM image files for the models of Apple II you wish to emulate.  These go into the "ROMs" sub-folder when you get them.

The included User Guide explains all this and more in better detail.  A more recent edition of the guide might also be available from where you downloaded the software, as it will sometimes be updated on a different schedule than the software.  All materials related to Catakig, including downloads, are currently accessible through SourceForge:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/catakig

... or from Catakig's main website, also in the vicinity:

  http://catakig.sourceforge.net/

This is a beta release, and hence a little rough around the edges.  The author encourages feedback, questions, and discussion.
