<p>
For anyone reading Catakig's source code, hoping to make some sense of it, here's a brief summary . . .

<h3>FILE (DIS-)ORGANIZATION</h3>

<p>
The source code is grouped into three major parts:

<ol>
<li>the MacOS X Cocoa application (in Source/Cocoa)
<li>the Apple II emulation library (in Source/LibAppleII)
<li>generally useful C and Objective-C stuff, not specific to this project (in Source/Misc)
</ol>

<p>
Part 1 depends on parts 2 & 3.  Part 2 depends on part 3.  Part 1 is allowed
to have Cocoa-specific code, whereas the other two are meant to be portable,
and should rely only on <i>FoundationKit</i>, <i>AppKit</i>, standard
Unix APIs, and other common toolkits.
<p>
File <b>Prefix.pch</b> is the project's pre-compiled header file.  Its content is
implicitly included by every source file.
<p>
The <b>LibAppleII</b> emulation library is driven from the outside.  (You call it -- it doesn't call you.)  The client of the library, the surrounding application, is expected to pass along all relevant user input, to call the 65c02 interpreter, and to call the video frame renderer, whenever these tasks are needed.  The library doesn't initiate any action on its own.
<p>
Documentation of the source code is pretty scant right now.  Most methods do have a brief summary at their beginning, and most files have a few comments at the top describing the contents.  But there isn't anything right now to document how the whole thing hangs together.

<h3>DESIGN GOALS</h3>

<p>
Adhere as much as possible to POSIX, OpenGL, and the common subset of Cocoa and GNUStep.  Maybe port someday to generic Linux/BSD + GNUStep platforms.  OpenAL might be a another good standard, for audio output.
<p>
For MacOS X platforms, target 10.3 and avoid 10.4+ features.  (Occasionally review this decision though.)  It would be nice to support 10.2 as well, as I was trying to do initially, but it seems time to move on.  Note that MacOS X on Intel is always at least 10.4.
<p>
For now, don't bother supporting arbitrary Apple II peripherals in arbitrary slot configurations.  Rather, aim for a "canonical" Apple II with the same feature set across all models.  These features are:

<ul>
<li>a printer, slot #1
<li>a Mockingboard sound card, slot #2.  (The IIc has a serial port for modems in
slot #2, but this can be used to talk to the Mockingboard D.  Supporting modems under emulation is probably pointless today anyway.)
<li>a ThunderClock-compatible clock card, slot #3?
<li>a "Slinky" RAM card, slot #4
<li>a pair of ProDOS/SmartPort drives, slot #5
<li>a pair of Disk II 5.25-inch drives, slot #6
<li> mouse?, slot #7
</ul>

<h3>NAMING CONVENTIONS IN THE SOURCE</h3>

<p>
In general, identifiers are in mixed-case form (e.g. "doItNow") -- except C pre-processor macros, which follow the ancient C tradition of being all uppercase with words separated by underscores ("DO_IT_NOW").
<p>
All LibAppleII identifiers in the publicly visible scope, except enum constants, begin with "A2".
<p>
Enumeration constants begin with "kf" when they're flags (integers having a single 1 bit, e.g. 0x400), "ks" when bit-shift values (0 to 31), "km" when bit-masks (e.g. 0x3FF), and just "k" otherwise.  Public enumeration constants in LibAppleII also have "A2" in their prefix.  Flag and shift values often come in associated pairs: e.g. "kfALTZP" and "ksALTZP".
<p>
Names of object instance variables begin with "m" and are mixed-case (e.g. "mFavoriteColor").  This seems to go against popular Objective-C practice, but I don't care.  It helps me.
<p>
Methods supplied by the author that don't exist in the standard class
libraries have capitalized names.  For example: "InputChar" and not
"inputChar" -- but on the other hand "keyDown" and not "KeyDown".  In other
words, lower-cased methods will have some pre-defined purpose through class
inheritance, whereas the upper-cased methods are
new additions.  Again, this is a personal convention that helps me.
<p>
Methods begining with an underscore ( _ ) are considered private to the class,
and for internal use only.  Objective-C has no "private" attribute like C++ does
to enforce this behavior however.  Any Objective-C message can be sent to
any object at any time.  But the underscore alerts the reader that the method
isn't supposed to be called by just anybody.

<h3>CODING HABITS OF THE AUTHOR THAT WILL ANNOY YOU</h3>

<p>
Hard tabs are used throughout the source, and are expected to be 4 spaces wide.
Might switch to soft tabs (all spaces) at some point.
<p>
The author often exploits the fact that C literal strings are arrays
of constant characters, that C characters can also serve as small
integers, and that therefore short literal strings make handy little
in-line lookup tables of small integers.  Here's an example:

<pre>
  number_of_one_bits = "\0\1\1\2\1\2\2\3"[n]
</pre>

You're probably entitled to be outraged at this practice.

<p>
Comments ending with "??" or "!!" are considered temporary, and not part
of the settled in-line documentation -- if such a thing will ever exist.
These annotations usually mark code that is volatile, experimental, or
whose need is questionable.
<p>
There are some C99 (and non-C89) features used pretty frequently: (1) declaring
for-loop variables in-line; (2) initializing structure fields by name
instead of by position.  The first one is pretty well known, but use of the second feature doesn't seem very widespread and might be a surprise to some.
<p>
The author prefers using "and", "or", and "not" over "&&", "||" and "!".
Macros defining these pseudo-keywords are in <b>Prefix.pch</b>.
